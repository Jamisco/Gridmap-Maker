It seems most of the time (70% - 80%) is spent in the CreateFusedMeshes Update function.
	- That CreateFusedMeshes function is the ShapeMeshFuser.Update Function. 
	- The good news is that we have successfully optimized our insert method such that it is now insignificant
	- Additionally, whenever we update the map, we wont have to redraw the whole thing. We also redraw parts of the map that have been changed, 
	- I tested highlighting a single cell. This was done by, get the cell at (0,0), deep copy it, change its color, and then insert it back into the map.
		- This was done in 0.004 - 0.013 seconds. If was usually .004 after the first time. JIT compiler and all
