It seems most of the time (70% - 80%) is spent in the CreateFusedMeshes Update function.
	- That CreateFusedMeshes function is the ShapeMeshFuser.Update Function. 
	- The good news is that we have successfully optimized our insert method such that it is now insignificant
	- Additionally, whenever we update the map, we wont have to redraw the whole thing. We also redraw parts of the map that have been changed, 
	- I tested highlighting a single cell. This was done by, get the cell at (0,0), deep copy it, change its color, and then insert it back into the map.
		- This was done in 0.004 - 0.013 seconds. If was usually .004 after the first time. JIT compiler and all

For thesame gridSize, however if we make each individual position its own unique position,
these are the stats we get. Not good!
